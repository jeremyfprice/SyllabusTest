# Reading for the Course

You are expected to complete the readings for the week or the session prior to the start of the week or session. We will be discussing these readings in class, drawing upon their ideas and concepts, and you will be asked to support your statements with evidence from the readings. I will also help you to make sense of these readings by helping you find the important and salient concepts. I recommend using the SQ3R Method for reading for this course (and all courses), which is illustrated and described in the Course Tools and Practices companion document.
