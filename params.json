Somehow or another, skill and knowledge are integrated into some kind of a human connection.\" ~ Mike Rose\r\n\r\n**Welcome to EDUC2201, Instructional Technology.** We will be exploring the different ways that technology can be used to support learning, understanding, and creativity in the classroom or in other types of learning environments. We will be paying attention to the role that you play as facilitator and designer of materials and of the environment to encourage learning, understanding, and creativity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![Tree](tree.png)\r\n\r\n*This syllabus is your map for success in this course.
