# A Note About Communications

Communications between me and you outside of class time will occur over email. Blackboard will not be used in this class. I have access only to your Fairmont State email address, so please make sure to check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.
