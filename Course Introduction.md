# Course Introduction and Expectations

## Course Throughlines

The *course throughlines* are the goals that help us get to the kinds of
teaching superheroes we strive towards.

    Learn to speak like a teacher
    
    Using vocabulary of the profession is important and will help you
    communicate with your professors and colleagues in a precise and professional manner. We will therefore be using the ideas and language
    of the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework. According to
    TfU,*throughlines* â€œdescribe the most important understandings that
    students should develop during an entire course.â€ Throughlines are the big ideas that we will be exploring and developing understandings around over the semester.

###Helping you build upon professional standards

    The three throughlines in the course are oriented to help you understand and build upon the National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers (NETS•T):

    1. Facilitate and inspire student creativity and learning: Use digital technologies to develop multimedia products that customize and personalize learning activities and assessments to address students’ diverse learning styles, working strategies, and abilities.
    2. Design digital age learning experiences: Design technology integrated projects-based learning experiences that engage students in exploring real world issues and solving authentic problems.
    3. Model digital age work and learning: Develop problem solving skills to effectively use current and emerging digital tools to locate, analyze, and evaluate information resources for their potential to improve learning in the content areas.
    4. Professional growth and leadership: Use Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with peers and reflect on effective uses of technology to enhance learning and teaching.
    5. Collaborative knowledge construction: Collaborate with K-12 students using digital tools and resources to support student success and innovation.
    6. Communicate Relevant Information: Communicate relevant information and ideas effectively to a particular audience using a digital tool appropriately.
    7. Digital Citizenship: Model safe, legal and ethical uses of digital information and technology including respect for copyright, intellectual property, and the appropriate documentation of resources to responsibly to plan and facilitate student learning.

##Universal Learning
I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.

Any student with particular needs should contact the coordinator of Disability Services at the start of the semester. Services are available to any student, full or part-time, who has a need because of a [documented] disability.  It is the student's responsibility to register for services with the coordinator of students with disabilities and to provide any necessary documentation to verify a disability or the need for accommodations.  The coordinator of Disability Services can be reached at (304) 367-4686 or (800) 641-5678 Ext. 8. You and I can work out the details of any accommodations for this course.

##Course Expectations and Activities
I view the learning process as an interactive endeavor in which you and I both have responsibilities. My roles are to design an engaging, relevant, productive course, facilitate class activities that I believe will be effective in the learning process, to assess your work in a fair, timely manner, and create a safe, supportive space in which everyone can be who she or he is and freely contribute to the class. Your role in the learning process is to attend class sessions, complete all of the assignments fully and to the best of your ability, and to participate in class discussions and activities.

###Attendance
Being present is important to success in this class. Research has found that simply showing up is a better predictor of student success in college classes than many other factors, including past academic success (Credé, Roch, and Kieszczynka, 2010). There is a direct correlation between your participation in the class and what you will learn.

As such, this course requires that you maintain an open line of communications with me about your absences from this class. Although I would prefer to be notified ahead of time of your absence, if you have an excuse for your absence you have 24 hours after class to notify me.

Each teacher candidate in EDUC2201 receives one “Ooops!” day, as I understand that forgetting to communicate with me happens. Each unexcused absence after that day will result in 1 point deducted from your final grade. If you have a 92 (an A on your transcript) for your final grade with 5 unexcused absences, you will receive an 88 for your final grade (a B on your transcript) after the “Ooops!” day adjustment. I will be posting your attendance status on TaskStream each month.

 >"There is something incredibly brave and daring about showing up and putting your ideas [out there].... Whatever your daring is, however you are trying to show up in your life, I think there is something incredibly contagious and powerful about it. I think it makes the people around us a little bit braver, and I think it helps us get very clear on the ideals and values that guide our lives." ~Brene Brown on On Being.

I recognize that students are required to miss class for many different reasons. The important thing to remember is to keep an open line of communications with me so your grade is not adversely affected.

Arriving on time is also important, and is a sign of respect to your classmates and the instructor. Each class will begin with a cognitive warm-up, a short activity designed to help teacher candidates make the transition into class and to help everyone get on the same page for a successful class. If you arrive during the cognitive warm-up, please wait outside in the hall until the activity is over. Use this time to take a deep breath and mentally prepare for class until the activity is over, when you are welcome to come in and find a seat.

##Submitting Assignments
As a pre-professional courtesy to yourself, your professor, and your classmates, it is important to submit assignments on time on the due date. All assignments are due in TaskStream before Pumpkin Hour (11:59pm). It is best not to wait until the **Very Last Minute** to submit assignments on TaskStream, as the submission process requires several steps.

I completely understand that life happens and emergencies, illnesses, and other situations come up when you least want them to. If you are involved in an emergency, illness, or situation, please inform me via email as soon as possible, preferably before the due date, and we can discuss an extension. I also understand that things may happen on the date an assignment is due, so every student in EDUC2201 has a “Things Happen Buffer.” You have 24 hours after the due date to contact me via email to request an extension because of an emergency, illness, or situation, although the sooner you contact me the better. With no communications, an assignment submitted one day late will receive a 5% grade deduction. Extensions will not be granted after the “Things Happen Buffer.” See the schedule above to understand how your grade is affected over the course of a week after the due date. Assignments will not be accepted if they are 8 or more days late, and you will receive no points for the assignment.

##Reading for the Course

You are expected to complete the readings for the week or the session prior to the start of the week or session. We will be discussing these readings in class, drawing upon their ideas and concepts, and you will be asked to support your statements with evidence from the readings. I will also help you to make sense of these readings by helping you find the important and salient concepts. I recommend using the SQ3R Method for reading for this course (and all courses), which is illustrated and described in the Course Tools and Practices companion document.

##Required Resources

We will be using The Teaching for Understanding Guide by Tina Blythe and colleagues. The Teaching for Understanding Guide (TfUG) provides an excellent overview of the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework filled with accounts from practicing teachers and explanations from educational researchers. TfU provides you with an excellent language and framework for considering standards, planning lessons and curricula, and addressing individual students. TfUG is a valuable addition to any teachers’ bookshelf. The readings from the book will be supplemented with online readings.

You will be required to use TaskStream to submit your performances of understanding. A multiyear license is available through the University Bookstore or through TaskStream. For more information, visit http://bit.ly/fsu-taskstream.
