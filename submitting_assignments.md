# Submitting Assignments

As a pre-professional courtesy to yourself, your professor, and your classmates, it is important to submit assignments on time on the due date. All assignments are due in TaskStream before Pumpkin Hour (11:59pm). It is best not to wait until the Very Last Minute to submit assignments on TaskStream, as the submission process requires several steps.

I completely understand that life happens and emergencies, illnesses, and other situations come up when you least want them to. If you are involved in an emergency, illness, or situation, please inform me via email as soon as possible, preferably before the due date, and we can discuss an extension. I also understand that things may happen on the date an assignment is due, so every student in EDUC2201 has a “Things Happen Buffer.” You have 24 hours after the due date to contact me via email to request an extension because of an emergency, illness, or situation, although the sooner you contact me the better. With no communications, an assignment submitted one day late will receive a 5% grade deduction. Extensions will not be granted after the “Things Happen Buffer.” See the schedule above to understand how your grade is affected over the course of a week after the due date. Assignments will not be accepted if they are 8 or more days late, and you will receive no points for the assignment.
