# Required Resources

We will be using The Teaching for Understanding Guide by Tina Blythe and colleagues. The Teaching for Understanding Guide (TfUG) provides an excellent overview of the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework filled with accounts from practicing teachers and explanations from educational researchers. TfU provides you with an excellent language and framework for considering standards, planning lessons and curricula, and addressing individual students. TfUG is a valuable addition to any teachersâ€™ bookshelf. The readings from the book will be supplemented with online readings.

You will be required to use TaskStream to submit your performances of understanding. A multiyear license is available through the University Bookstore or through TaskStream. For more information, visit http://bit.ly/fsu-taskstream.
