<p><strong>Welcome to EDUC2201, Instructional Technology.</strong> We will be exploring the different ways that technology can be used to support learning, understanding, and creativity in the classroom or in other types of learning environments. We will be paying attention to the role that you play as facilitator and designer of materials and of the environment to encourage learning, understanding, and creativity.</p>

<p><em>This syllabus is your map for success in this course. I am here to help you to succeed in this course and in the teacher education program. I will provide you with information, models, and scaffolding in the syllabus and other companion documents. These companion documents
include Reference Sheets, Assignment Guidelines, and Model Assignments. Success in this class involves organizing and understanding these sources of information; we will go over the syllabus in depth during the first class, and I am happy to meet with you to discuss the course and its requirements further.</em></p>
