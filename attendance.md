# Attendance and Timeliness
Being present is important to success in this class. Research has found that simply showing up is a better predictor of student success in college classes than many other factors, including past academic success (Credé, Roch, and Kieszczynka, 2010). There is a direct correlation between your participation in the class and what you will learn.

As such, this course requires that you maintain an open line of communications with me about your absences from this class. Although I would prefer to be notified ahead of time of your absence, if you have an excuse for your absence you have 24 hours after class to notify me.

Each teacher candidate in EDUC2201 receives one “Ooops!” day, as I understand that forgetting to communicate with me happens. Each unexcused absence after that day will result in 1 point deducted from your final grade. If you have a 92 (an A on your transcript) for your final grade with 5 unexcused absences, you will receive an 88 for your final grade (a B on your transcript) after the “Ooops!” day adjustment. I will be posting your attendance status on TaskStream each month.

I recognize that students are required to miss class for many different reasons. The important thing to remember is to keep an open line of communications with me so your grade is not adversely affected.

Arriving on time is also important, and is a sign of respect to your classmates and the instructor. Each class will begin with a cognitive warm-up, a short activity designed to help teacher candidates make the transition into class and to help everyone get on the same page for a successful class. If you arrive during the cognitive warm-up, please wait outside in the hall until the activity is over. Use this time to take a deep breath and mentally prepare for class until the activity is over, when you are welcome to come in and find a seat.

>“There is something incredibly brave and daring about showing up and putting your ideas [out there].... Whatever your daring is, however you are trying to show up in your life, I think there is something incredibly contagious and powerful about it. I think it makes the people around us a little bit braver, and I think it helps us get very clear on the ideals and values that guide our lives.”
